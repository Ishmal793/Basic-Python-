# Basic-Python-
# 🐍 Python Basics – Beginner Level

This repository contains Python basics that cover all the essential topics for absolute beginners in programming. These notes and code examples are designed to help you understand the building blocks of Python, which is the backbone of Data Analytics and Data Science.

## 📌 Description

When I first started learning Python, I created this notebook to understand and practice fundamental concepts. Today, whenever I revisit this code, it helps me revise and refresh my Python basics — and I hope it does the same for you!

## 🎯 Why This Matters?

Python is the backbone of modern Data Analytics. Mastering these basics builds a strong foundation for advanced libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and tools like Power BI, SQL, and Excel. This is a part of my learning journey, and I'm sharing it to help others who are just starting.
